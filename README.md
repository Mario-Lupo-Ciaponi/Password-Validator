# Password-Validator
This is a mini project that check if the password is valid based on the criteria. 

## Criteria:
- The password's length must be at least 16 character long;
- The password must contain at least one digit;
- The password must contain at least one uppercase letter;
- The password must contain at least one lowercase letter;
- The password must contain at least one special symbol(e.g. '.', '-', '*' and so on);

## Why password validations are important:
An app or site that has a registration must have a password validation to prevent stealing of user's data due to 
them having weak passwords.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this mini project is to practice the data type 'stack', Git and GitHub skills. The criteria cannot promise
the strongest password, however the passwords that it says that are valid - are not weak either.
